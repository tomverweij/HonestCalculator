<h2>The average of all numbers</h2>
<p>Write a program that reads 2 numbers, <code class="java">a</code> and <code class="java">b</code>, from the input. As an output, it shows the mean of all numbers that lie on the interval between <code class="java">a</code> and <code class="java">b</code><em>,</em> and are divisible by 3. </p>
<p>What does it mean? Let's say, you need to calculate the mean of the numbers in the range <span class="math-tex">\( [-5; 12] \)</span>. The numbers divided by 3 without the remainder are: <span class="math-tex">\(-3, 0, 3, 6, 9, 12\)</span>. Their sum is <span class="math-tex">\(27\)</span>, there are six of them, so the mean is <span class="math-tex">\(27 \div 6 = 4.5\)</span>.</p>
<p>The input interval always contains at least one dividend of 3. Remember to include the values of <code class="java">a</code> and <code class="java">b</code> in your calculations.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> To calculate the mean, you need to get the sum of the found integers and divide it by the number of these found integers. To get the divider, consider using a separate variable for counting the number of found integers: it should have 0 as the starting value, then 1 should be added to it each time you find an integer that can be divided by 3.</p><br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">-5<br>12</code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">4.5</code></pre><br><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 5 seconds</font><br><br>
