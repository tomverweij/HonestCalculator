<p></p><p>What numbers will the code print? </p><pre><code class="language-python">for x in range(1, 3):
    for y in range(-2, 0):
        print(x * y)</code></pre><p>Enter them in the correct order, all in one line, separated by space.</p><p><b>Tip:</b> Remember that the last number in range won't be included. Also, pay close attention to the order in which the nested loops are executed. </p>
